To check before going to field:
Climber hooks retracted(high priority)

To do on code:

early:
tune intake pivot asap(probably off traversal climb branch b/c buttons bindings are correct)
if have climber potentiometer, adjust code to use that, should just need to change the return in climber
test climber again(first check climber max tilt negative(towards shooter) is <-28)
tune hhh, left joystick 11 should turn 90 degrees, tune until it does, then its just a matter of running it a few times for distances and shoot way downtown
relable auto switch, dio5 is now third ball high y/n(plugged = hhh)
tune climber so clutch doesn't slip on unhooking
move climber limit switch to winch so you can zero that instea

later:
Merge code and make sure climber calibrates during auto
test as if playing a full game
